				<p><strong>Remember, ALWAYS go with your gut. Take our responses with a grain of salt, and if you feel

		<p id="t2"> 1.DON'T: Address him at all if you're in an isolated place. If you're in an enclosed space, such a subway car or elevator, or alone on a street, Arthur says you shouldn't hand out a card or address a cat caller for risk of escalating the situation. </p>

		<p id= "t3">2. DO: Speak up. There is a big difference between verbal cat calling and breaking a physical boundary. "That's a situation that warrants a more significant response," Arthur says. "If a physical boundary is broken, you need to address it in a more confident way." But that doesn't mean you should fight back - in fact, getting physical should be a last resort, Arthur says. "Use clear, concise phrases, like 'Stop. Don't touch me,' or 'Leave me alone,' while maintaining eye contact to get your point across."  </p>
		<p id= "t4"> 3. DON'T: Hesitate to call authorities. "So often women don't want to call the police because they don't want to overreact, but any time you're feeling vulnerable you need to listen to your gut instincts," Arthur says. She says that she often hears from victims of attacks that they had a feeling something was wrong, but they didn't do anything about it.</p>
		<p id= "t5"> 4. DO: Make a scene. "Try to move a populated area if someone is following you or trying to grope you, and draw attention to yourself by yelling specific words: 'I need help!' 'Attacker!'" Arthur says. "You can't go over the top if you feel threatened. The saying 'Better safe than sorry' really applies to this situation."</p>
